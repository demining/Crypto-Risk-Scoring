<p><strong>List of cryptocurrency hacks since January 2021</strong></p>



<p>At this rate, 2022 is likely to surpass 2021 as the biggest year for hacks on record.&nbsp;So far, hackers have made over $3 billion from 125 hacks,”&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Chainalysis, October 12, 2022, via Twitter</em></p>



<p>Analyst firm Chainalysis called October 2022 “the biggest month of the year with the biggest hacking activity,” with the total hack cost for the month nearly reaching $718 million.</p>



<p>Even though no more than half a month has passed, Chainalysis reported that 11 different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol hacks have been used by hundreds of millions of people.</p>



<p>Cross-chain bridges are the biggest target for hackers, with three bridges accounting for 82% of losses in October this month.&nbsp;According to Chainalysis, the largest of these bridge hacks was an approximately $100 million exploit in the bridge between the Binance BNB Smart Chain crypto exchange and Beacon Chain.</p>
